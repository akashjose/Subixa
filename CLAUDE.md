# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repo.

## What this is

A media player built from scratch: **Qt 6.9 + QML + libmpv**. Not a fork of VLC,
Haruna, or SMPlayer — libmpv is a dependency, not a base.

The distinguishing feature is a **docked subtitle browser** (PotPlayer-style): per-track
tabs, timestamped rows, search, click-to-seek, auto-follow during playback. Everything
else is table stakes to support that.

## Environment

Runs in **WSL2, Ubuntu 24.04** (vhdx at `F:\WSL\Ubuntu-24.04`). The repo lives on the
native ext4 fs, deliberately **not** under `/mnt/*` — those are 9p mounts and several
times slower for build workloads.

| | |
|---|---|
| Qt | 6.9.3 at `~/Qt/6.9.3/gcc_64` (system Qt is 6.4.2 — too old, do not use) |
| libmpv | 0.37, client API 2.2.0, from apt |
| FFmpeg | 6.1.1 (`libavformat` 60.16.100, `libavcodec` 60.31.102) |
| Compiler | gcc 13.3.0, C++17, CMake 3.28.3 + Ninja |
| Display | WSLg. **Software rendering only** — no GPU decode. Expected, not a bug. |

## Build and run

```bash
cd ~/code/custom_media_player
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/Qt/6.9.3/gcc_64"     # required, or CMake finds Qt 6.4
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
./build/custom_media_player testclip.mp4
```

`testclip.mp4` is a generated 15 s testsrc2 clip with burned-in timecode — useful because
you can visually confirm the rendered frame matches the seek bar. It has **no subtitle
track**; generate one when working on the browser.

Subtitle fixtures (`testclip.mp4` has no subtitle track):

```bash
./testdata/make-fixtures.sh          # embedded, sidecar, shifted-timeline cases
./testdata/make-fixtures.sh --big    # plus huge.mp4, a 200k-cue ASS sidecar
```

Headless run:

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen timeout 6 ./build/custom_media_player testdata/subs.mkv
```

**Know what this does and does not check.** `offscreen` never renders the scene graph, so
`createFramebufferObject()` never runs, the mpv render context is never created, and the
queued `loadFile` is never flushed — mpv does not load the file at all (zero `[mpv]` log
lines). It verifies that the app starts and the QML parses, nothing about playback.
Subtitle parsing *does* run, because it never touches the render context, so this is a
real check on the extractor.

Anything about playback or rendering needs a real window. Check the log for
`VO: [libmpv]`; anything else means the render path is broken (see trap 1). Note that
WSLg windows are Wayland surfaces and do **not** show up in an XWayland root grab
(`ffmpeg -f x11grab -i :0.0` comes back black, with or without `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb`) —
screenshots have to be taken from the Windows side.

## Architecture

```
src/MpvObject.{h,cpp}         QQuickFramebufferObject + libmpv OpenGL render API
src/main.cpp                  forces OpenGL RHI, passes argv[1] to QML as `initialFile`
src/SubtitleTypes.h           SubtitleLine / SubtitleTrack plain structs
src/SubtitleExtractor.{h,cpp} libavformat/libavcodec parsing, runs on a worker thread
src/SubtitleManager.{h,cpp}   QML-facing owner of the worker and the parsed tracks
qml/Main.qml                  video + transport + docked subtitle panel
```

`MpvObject` owns an `mpv_handle`; the nested `MpvRenderer` (render thread) owns the
`mpv_render_context` and draws into the FBO. mpv state reaches QML through observed
properties (`time-pos`, `duration`, `pause`) surfaced as Qt properties.

`SubtitleManager` runs a `SubtitleExtractor` on its own `QThread` and republishes results
as bindable properties. Requests carry a monotonic id; bumping it makes an in-flight parse
abandon its demux loop, so opening a second file does not wait on the first. The two
`QVariantList` accessors (`tracks`, `lines()`) are a stopgap — `lines()` copies the whole
track on the GUI thread (~110 ms for 40k cues, ~600 ms for 200k) and milestone 2's
`QAbstractListModel` replaces it.

**Why the render API and not `--wid`:** with `--wid`, mpv draws into a separate native
surface *above* the scene graph, so QML cannot reliably paint over it. The whole feature
premise is QML chrome composited on the video, so `--wid` is not an option.

## Traps — all of these have already cost time

1. **`vo=libmpv` must be set before `mpv_initialize`.** Without it mpv picks a native VO
   (`wlshm` under WSLg), creates **its own Wayland surface**, and never touches the FBO.
   Video appears *outside* the app window and steals input. Looks like a compositing bug;
   it is not.
2. **The render context does not exist until the item first renders.** It is created in
   `createFramebufferObject()`, which runs *after* QML's `Component.onCompleted`. Calling
   `loadFile()` earlier gives `No render context set` → `Video: no video`, with no picture
   and no obvious error. Early loads are queued and flushed in `onRenderContextReady()`.
   **Any new mpv command that must run before first paint needs the same treatment.**
3. **`target_include_directories(... PRIVATE src)` is mandatory.** qmltyperegistrar emits
   `#if __has_include(<MpvObject.h>)`; without `src/` on the include path that guard is
   silently false and the build fails with `QQuickItem was not declared` — nowhere near
   the real cause.
4. **`QOpenGLFramebufferObject` is in QtOpenGL, not QtGui** (Qt 6 moved it;
   `QOpenGLContext` stayed in QtGui).

### Subtitle extraction

5. **Every ffmpeg text subtitle decoder emits ASS, and the field layout is not the one in
   an `.ass` file.** SRT, ASS and `mov_text` all come back as
   `ReadOrder,Layer,Style,Name,MarginL,MarginR,MarginV,Effect,Text` — the text starts
   after the **8th** comma, and the first field is a read order counter, *not* a
   timestamp. Timings come from the packet, not the payload. Splitting as if it were a
   file's `Dialogue:` line silently eats the first words of every cue.
6. **Rebase against the container start time per track, not wholesale.** mpv shifts
   playback to start at zero (`--rebase-start-time`, on by default), so an MPEG-TS that
   starts an hour in needs the same shift or every seek lands 3600 s out. But muxers do
   produce files whose video starts at 1 h while the subtitle stream still starts at 0
   (`testdata/shifted.mp4`); subtracting there flattens every cue onto `00:00:00`. Only
   shift a track whose own first cue is at or past the offset.
7. **ffmpeg does not decode character entities.** Its SRT/WebVTT decoders convert `<i>`
   into ASS override tags but leave `&amp;`, `&#39;` and friends literal — they would show
   up raw in the browser *and* break search. Decoding is on our side.
8. **Bitmap vs text is a codec property, not a name list.** `avcodec_descriptor_get()`
   exposes `AV_CODEC_PROP_TEXT_SUB` / `AV_CODEC_PROP_BITMAP_SUB`; use those rather than
   matching codec names, and the classification stays right as codecs are added.
   (ffmpeg cannot transcode text to bitmap, so there is no way to *generate* a PGS/VOBSUB
   fixture locally — that path is verified against the codec table, not a file.)

Known-harmless: CMake warns `QTP0004` about qmldir files for `qml/`. Cosmetic.
mpv logs `Suspected software renderer`, EGL/DRM/Vulkan probe failures, and
`Cannot load libcuda.so.1` — all expected under WSL with `hwdec=no`.

## Conventions

- C++17, 4-space indent, Qt naming (`m_` members, camelCase methods).
- Keep mpv-specific types out of `MpvObject.h` — it forward-declares `mpv_handle` and
  takes `void*` in `handleMpvEvent` so mpv headers stay in the .cpp.
- QML talks to mpv only through `Q_INVOKABLE`/properties on `MpvObject`. Do not reach
  into libmpv from QML.
- Subtitle parsing must **not** block the GUI thread.

## Next up

See `README.md` → Roadmap. Milestone 1 (subtitle extraction) is done: embedded and sidecar
tracks parse to timestamped rows off the GUI thread, and the docked panel lists them with
click-to-seek.

Immediate task is **Milestone 2: browser UI** — a `QAbstractListModel` per track fed from
`SubtitleManager::trackData()`, a `QSortFilterProxyModel` for incremental search, tabs
across tracks, and auto-follow driven by `lineIndexAt()` (already a binary search) with a
toggle so manual scrolling does not fight playback. Landing the model also removes the
`QVariantList` copy that currently stalls the GUI on track switch.

## Related context

This project came out of a WSL 22.04 → 24.04 migration. Its checklist lives at
`/mnt/f/WSL-migration/CHECKLIST.md` and holds environment history, the Qt/aqt module
gotchas, and deferred restore work. The old `Ubuntu` (22.04) distro still exists and still
hosts live Immich/Jellyfin/filebrowser containers — **do not unregister it**.
